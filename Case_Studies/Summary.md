# AI Incident Case Studies

Applied Governance and Operational Analysis

---

## Overview

This folder contains detailed case studies documenting major operational, safety, ethical, and compliance incidents involving AI-enabled systems.

Each case study presents a structured, evidence-based analysis of how failures were detected, managed, investigated, and remediated within a governed enterprise environment.

The case studies demonstrate applied capability in managing complex AI risks and translating operational failures into systemic improvements.

---

## Purpose

The primary objectives of these case studies are to:

* Illustrate real-world application of governance frameworks
* Demonstrate incident and problem management discipline
* Provide evidence of risk-based decision making
* Support professional and regulatory review
* Enable organizational learning and prevention

These documents serve as reference models for responsible AI operations.

---

## Analytical Standards

All case studies adhere to the following standards:

* Evidence-based analysis
* Cross-functional validation
* Conservative risk assessment
* Transparent documentation
* Governance-aligned remediation

Unverified assumptions and speculative conclusions are excluded.

---

## Relationship to Governance Frameworks

These case studies operationalize the governance frameworks located in `01_Frameworks/`.

Specifically, they demonstrate:

* Incident and problem management execution
* Risk framework integration
* Control validation practices
* Governance escalation and review processes

They serve as applied examples of framework implementation.

---

## Intended Audience

These materials are intended for:

* AI Operations and MLOps teams
* Risk and Compliance professionals
* Trust and Safety organizations
* Internal Audit functions
* Technical and executive leadership

They may also support training and capability development.

---

## Confidentiality and Anonymization

All case studies are anonymized and governance-compliant.

No proprietary systems, organizations, or individuals are identified.

Sensitive operational details are sanitized to protect confidentiality.

---

## Document Governance

Case studies are reviewed periodically to ensure:

* Continued relevance
* Regulatory alignment
* Accuracy of risk assessments
* Consistency with updated frameworks

Revisions are subject to governance approval.
