# Operational and Governance Methodologies

AI Incident, Risk, and Governance Practice

---

## Overview

This folder contains documented methodologies that define how AI system incidents, risks, and governance challenges are analyzed, investigated, and managed.

These methodologies provide structured, repeatable approaches to incident management, root cause analysis, risk integration, and governance decision-making.

They ensure analytical consistency, operational rigor, and regulatory defensibility.

---

## Purpose

The primary objectives of these methodologies are to:

* Standardize investigative and analytical practices
* Reduce variability in incident handling
* Strengthen evidence-based decision making
* Support audit and regulatory review
* Enable scalable governance operations

They serve as operational reference models.

---

## Methodology Portfolio

The following core methodologies are maintained.

---

### Incident Management Methodology

Focus Area
Detection, escalation, containment, and stabilization of AI system failures

Key Components

* Severity classification models
* Escalation and communication protocols
* Incident command structures
* Stabilization and recovery procedures
* Documentation standards

---

### Root Cause Analysis Methodology

Focus Area
Systematic identification of technical, operational, and governance failures

Key Components

* Five Whys analysis
* Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
* Causal chain reconstruction
* Dependency mapping
* Evidence validation

---

### Risk and Governance Methodology

Focus Area
Integration of incident findings into enterprise risk and control systems

Key Components

* Risk scoring and prioritization models
* Control design frameworks
* Risk acceptance governance
* Key Risk Indicator development
* Monitoring integration

---

### Evaluation and EvalOps Methodology

Focus Area
Governance of model evaluation, validation, and performance assurance

Key Components

* Benchmark governance
* Drift and bias monitoring
* Safety and reliability testing
* Validation pipelines
* Release gating mechanisms

---

## Analytical Standards

All methodologies adhere to the following standards:

* Evidence-based reasoning
* Multi-source validation
* Conservative risk interpretation
* Clear documentation
* Independent review

Assumptions are explicitly stated and tested.

---

## Relationship to Frameworks and Reports

These methodologies operationalize the governance frameworks in:

* `01_Frameworks/`

And support execution of:

* `02_Case_Studies/`
* `03_Post_Incident_Reports/`

They translate high-level governance principles into daily operational practice.

---

## Intended Audience

These methodologies are intended for:

* AI Operations and MLOps teams
* Risk and Compliance professionals
* Trust and Safety organizations
* Internal Audit teams
* Governance and Policy offices

They support training, standardization, and quality assurance.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Methodologies are reviewed and refined based on:

* Incident trend analysis
* Audit findings
* Regulatory developments
* Operational maturity assessments
* Emerging AI risk patterns

All updates follow formal governance processes.
