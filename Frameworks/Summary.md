# Governance Frameworks

AI Product Operations, Risk, and Governance

---

## Overview

This folder contains the foundational governance frameworks that define how AI-enabled systems are managed, monitored, and improved across their operational lifecycle.

These frameworks establish standardized, audit-ready processes for:

* Incident response and stabilization
* Root cause investigation
* Risk management and control design
* Institutional learning and prevention
* Governance oversight and accountability

Together, they form the structural backbone of the portfolio.

---

## Framework Portfolio

Two integrated governance frameworks are maintained in this repository.

---

### 1. AI Product Incident, Problem, and Risk Management Framework

This framework defines the end-to-end process for managing operational failures and performance degradation in AI systems.
###
[**Product Incident**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19v6PAWV_G8fWQQrRBWSsPet16b68q4oE/view?usp=drive_link)

#### Primary Objectives

* Enable early detection and rapid containment of incidents
* Ensure systematic root cause analysis
* Integrate operational findings into enterprise risk management
* Standardize control validation and monitoring
* Support regulatory and audit requirements

#### Core Lifecycle

The framework operates through the following stages:

1. Incident Management
   Detection, classification, containment, and stabilization

2. Problem Management
   Structured root cause investigation and causal analysis

3. Risk Management
   Risk reassessment, control enhancement, and monitoring updates

4. Governance Oversight
   Executive review, accountability, and compliance validation

#### Key Outcomes

* Reduced response variability
* Improved incident traceability
* Stronger operational discipline
* Enhanced audit defensibility

### 2. Post-Incident Resolution, Institutionalization, and Prevention Framework

This framework governs activities conducted after incident resolution to ensure that failures result in lasting organizational improvement.
###
[**Post-Incident**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tmn6-T4WWk0Y33ofID_U257M6Eg5hX7T/view?usp=drive_link)


#### Primary Objectives

* Convert incidents into institutional learning
* Strengthen preventive controls
* Preserve organizational knowledge
* Improve governance maturity
* Reduce recurrence probability

#### Integrated Lifecycle

The framework operates through seven structured stages:

1. Post-Incident Review (Postmortem)
2. Control Validation and Effectiveness Testing
3. Knowledge Integration and Institutionalization
4. Risk and Control Framework Enhancement
5. Governance and Leadership Review
6. Continuous Maturity Assessment
7. Proactive Prevention Feedback

#### Key Outcomes

* Structural prevention of repeat failures
* Embedded continuous improvement
* Strengthened executive oversight
* Mature governance culture

## Framework Integration

The two frameworks are designed to operate as a unified governance system.

### Operational Flow

Incident → Root Cause → Risk Integration → Resolution → Institutionalization → Prevention

### Governance Alignment

* The Incident–Problem–Risk Framework manages immediate and systemic response
* The Post-Incident Framework governs long-term learning and prevention

Together, they ensure both short-term stability and long-term resilience.

## Governance Principles

All frameworks are guided by the following principles:

* Evidence-based analysis
* Blameless accountability with leadership responsibility
* Prevention over correction
* Institutional memory preservation
* Continuous risk anticipation

These principles align with regulatory and industry expectations.

---

## Intended Use

These frameworks are intended to support:

* AI Operations and MLOps teams
* Risk and Compliance functions
* Trust and Safety organizations
* Internal Audit and Assurance teams
* Executive governance bodies

They may be adapted for organizational context while preserving core governance standards.

---

## Document Maintenance

Framework documents are reviewed and updated periodically based on:

* Incident trends
* Regulatory developments
* Audit findings
* Organizational maturity assessments

All updates are subject to governance approval.
